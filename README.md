# Custom Copilot for Financial Analysis on Nvidia's 10-Q Report

This project is a custom-built copilot leveraging AI search and Azure OpenAI services to assist users with financial analysis on Nvidia's 10-Q quarterly reports. It allows users to easily extract key insights from Nvidia's financial disclosures and provides contextual support in analyzing trends, financial health, and other critical aspects of the report.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Financial Analysis**: Utilizes AI models from Azure OpenAI to interpret complex financial data and highlight important trends, insights, and risks.
- **10-Q Report Parsing**: Reads and parses Nvidiaâ€™s 10-Q quarterly filings, enabling efficient extraction of financial data points and metrics.
- **Interactive Query System**: Users can interactively query the model to ask specific questions about the 10-Q report, such as revenue, expenses, liabilities, and risk factors.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: Provides insights into key sections of the report, including income statements, balance sheets, cash flow, and other relevant financial data.
- **Trends and Comparisons**: Allows for historical trend analysis, and comparisons with past financial performance.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: The Nvidia 10-Q report is uploaded to Azure search and converted to index using ada-embeddings-2 model.
2. **Data Parsing & Analysis**: The AI model, powered by Azure OpenAI, processes the data, extracting key financial metrics and other relevant information.
3. **Interactive Assistant**: Users can then ask questions or query the system for specific information, and the AI responds with contextualized answers or insights derived from the 10-Q data.
